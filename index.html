									<h3>Testimonials</h3>
									<p>
										<p>
											<span><i>"I am currently going to Purdue and I don’t think I would be where I am now without Lily’s help. When I was completely
											lost at the beginning, she helped guide me to figure out what I wanted to do, what kind of school I wanted, and where
											and tried to find the best options. I don’t feel like she pushed me towards big name schools just because they sound
											good on paper, but instead tried to find what fits me the best. Whenever I needed help or had a question, she would
											respond really quickly by email and would give plenty of details."</i></span><br />
											<span style="float:right">- Izabela B. (Student)</span>
										</p><br>
										<p>
											<span><i>"Lily's knowledge about Gunn High School's curriculum is exceptional. When we bring up a college/university for consideration, Lily can immediately talk at length about different aspects of it. My daughter really trusts and respects her advice. She has a passion for what she is doing -- we can tell!"</i></span><br />
											<span style="float:right">- Maggie (Parent)</span>
